# <b> Research Question
  
#### In my research I plan to explore the relationship between the formation of the Klu Klux Klan in Alabama in conjunction with racial terror lynchings of African-Americans across the state. The research will compare data that includes the dates and places where klan chapters where formed and data that includes the dates and places where Alabama racial terror lynchings occurred. Using this information will give some idea to the relationship between racial terror lynchings in Alabama and klan chapters. By utilizing this information the intended goal is to figure to determine whether racial terror lynchings increased/decreased in areas where klan chapters were formed. This will also help understand whether the formation of klan chapters in certain state regions were influenced by areas where racial terror lynchings were already occuring.

# <b> Why This Matters
#### As a descendant of an Alabama racial terror lynching victim who was honored at Bryan Stevenson's EJI memorial, I know the residual effects of lynchings as violent acts on generations of Southern African-American families. To date there is only one research project that maps the formation of the klan chapers across the United States. This research project, Virginia Commonwealth University's “Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940” pinpoints where more than 2000 local “klaverns" formed. Although racial terror lynchings have been mapped and even more extensively in the past few years with the formation of the EJI Memorial, the formation of klan chapters and racial terror lynchings exist in silos of research and public acknowledgement. It is the aim of this project to have both side by side as it is imperative for the case for reparations which is at the forefront of political discussions across the country.
 
# <b> Spatial and Temporal Scope
#### The original data came from the NAACP Lynching Records at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama. This data will take a limited look only at lynchings occuring in Alabama from a more broadly based dataset from Project Hal which compiles lynching from across the country.  The original data came from the NAACP Lynching Records at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama. The actual dates of the racial terror lynchings within my dataset are dervied from EJI data. The dates of the lynchings within the data are from 1877 to 1943. In addition, a limited amount of data will be used only analyzing Alabama from the larger dataset on klan chapter formations. Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan, 1915-1940 is a dataset. The dates for each Klavern come from the publication listed for that entry. So, it is likely that the Klaverns identified were established even earlier than the date indicated.

# <b> Data Sources
#### I will be using racial terror lynching data from the Project Hal: Historical American Lynching Data Collection Project.

#### I will be Klux Klux Klan formation data from Mapping the Second Ku Klux Klan which is a rough timeline of the rise of the second Ku Klux Klan between 1915 and 1940.

Lastly, I may also add another dataset that gives more details about each racial terrror lynching such as the mob size.

# <b> Analysis and Visualizations
#### This project will analyze the relationship between klan formations in Alabama and whether that overlaps with the occurence of racial terror lynchings of African-Americans or if there is any relations ship at all. The visualizations may include a dot map for the racial terror lynchings and a heat map for the klan formatioins or vice versa. In addition, I would like to graph the dates of lynchings by the years in regions of ALabama, if time permits
  
# Conclusions and Expectations
#### I want to strive to provide a template for how to contrast and acknowlede racial terror lynchings as an American problem and the Klu Klux Klan as a domestic terrorist group. My aim is for this project to provide clear insight on the relationship between the klan formation and racial terror lynchings  at least in Alabama. Alabama is a great focal because it is home to the first racial terror lynching memorial, but is also home of the Civil Rights Movement's most pivotal moments. It is important to garner knowledge on the past in order to rectify the future for descendants on both sides of the spectrum in the the dicsussion of reparations or any reconciliation around healing.
